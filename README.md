# Full-Stack
This project demonstrates a full-stack web application using a Spring Boot back-end and React front-end. The back-end APIs are built with Java using the Spring Boot framework for simplicity and rapid development. The database layer supports both MongoDB and MySQL databases using Spring Data JPA repositories.

The front-end is built using React with functional components and hooks for managing state and effects. React Router is used for navigation between views.
